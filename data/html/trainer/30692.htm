Master Stedmiel:<br>
Have you been to the Enchanted Valley? It is said that fairies hide there. At one time there was a custom of collecting the body parts of fairies for tokens and amulets. The Fairy King took his subjects deep into the Enchanted Forest to protect them from this terror.<br>
If this is true how frightened they must be, hiding from the vast number of adventurers swarming the place? May the song of stars give you happiness.<br>
Now, what can I do for you?<br>
