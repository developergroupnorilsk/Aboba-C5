In the northwestern part of the Cruma Marshlands, the Marsh Stakatos are trying to increase their power base. In the northeastern part, the Ol Mahum Partisans who could not return to their country after the war with Grecia are encamped. 
<br>
On top of that Enku Orcs, Tumran Bugbears, Delu Lizardmen etc. are watching for every opportunity to plunder the village. At the Execution Grounds located in the east, every night, the undead are pouring out.
<br>
You can say that we are facing enemies on all sides.
