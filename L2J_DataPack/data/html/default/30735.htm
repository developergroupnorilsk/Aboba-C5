Hello traveler with a fresh face. It's nice to meet you. My name is Sophya, commander of the 4th platoon of the Black Lion Mercenary Troop. Our platoon has been hired by the mayor of Town of Dion. Currently, we are assigned with the task of driving out evil spirits from Town of Dion and its surrounding areas. But the evil spirits in this area are too numerous for our platoon to deal with by ourselves and we are struggling right now.

If you are planning to travel to Gludio or Giran region, you had better prepare yourself for an attack by an Enku Orc or a Dire Wolf. Since, you look like you have enough skill to protect yourself, I don't think I need to worry about you that much !
