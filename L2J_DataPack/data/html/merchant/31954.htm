Pet Manager Saroyan:<br>
Are you interested in a pet? Let's see... Oh, forgive my staring! Sorry. I can't resist examining my customers' faces.<br>
I know it seems peculiar... It's just that many people want pets these days, but too often these animals wind up abused or abandoned. So I must scrutinize people before I feel comfortable with selling them a pet. No offense.<br>
