Magister Joan:<br>
Half of the Ivory Tower was destroyed during the Elmoraden Empire. At that time the Ivory Tower was powerful enough to control the continent, but after that it was transformed into a facility purely for research and education.<br>
Other Magisters may long for the days of the old regime, but personally, I think that the way the Ivory Tower functions today is better.<br>
